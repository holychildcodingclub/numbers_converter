A Number System Converter is a project created with Html, Css, and javascript . this   can be used to convert a number from one type to another type namely Decimals, Binary, Octal, and Hexadecimal.
In this project , we shall showcase  the making of a number system calculator using html, css  JavaScript. It will have the option to select the number type for input as well as the resulting output. The default input will be 1 that on change will show simultaneous results.

Steps
We shall then explore the steps below to arrive at our projects
•	We shall  Create a basic structure of the project  using hypertext markup language (HTML) elements such as form, section, and input for taking number input, and select an option element for dropdown input for number type along with relevant classes and ids.
•	Style the Html element or the structure  using  some CSS properties such as margin, padding, background color, color, display, width, font sizes, etc.
•	In JavaScript create the  function to update the values when input is added and a reverse function to update the values when other result input is changed to maintain the correct value
•	Access the HTML element using HTML DOM methods like document.getElementById and innerText and value methods to access and update the values on the  page.
